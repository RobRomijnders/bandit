Python implementation of CFR algorithm in **An introduction to Counterfactual Regret Minimazation** by Todd Neller and Marc Lanctot

The code uses same naming of functions and variables as the authors.

Expected output

```
Starting card  1. With history    , we PASS with p=0.00 BET with p=1.00
Starting card  1. With history   b, we PASS with p=1.00 BET with p=0.00
Starting card  1. With history   p, we PASS with p=1.00 BET with p=0.00
Starting card  1. With history  pb, we PASS with p=1.00 BET with p=0.00
Starting card  2. With history    , we PASS with p=1.00 BET with p=0.00
Starting card  2. With history   b, we PASS with p=1.00 BET with p=0.00
Starting card  2. With history   p, we PASS with p=1.00 BET with p=0.00
Starting card  2. With history  pb, we PASS with p=1.00 BET with p=0.00
Starting card  3. With history    , we PASS with p=0.20 BET with p=0.80
Starting card  3. With history   b, we PASS with p=0.00 BET with p=1.00
Starting card  3. With history   p, we PASS with p=0.00 BET with p=1.00
Starting card  3. With history  pb, we PASS with p=0.00 BET with p=1.00
